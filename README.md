**Purpose**
Staycationer is a site that helps you better appreciate your own home. Through a series of questions you are pointed to delightful locations within your household in which you can stay the evening. Instead of taking a costly vacation - why not camp in the bathroom for an evening? Or make a fort with your significant other in the broom closet with several books?

Staycationer is the best way to enjoy yourself without leaving the house.
